# Xpra 3.1.x branch
This branch of xpra replaces the 3.0.x LTS branch, for more details see [versions](https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/wiki/Versions)

Unlike the _fixes-only_ policy normally applied to the v3.0.x branch,
the 3.1.x branch includes backports from newer versions that are not strictly bug fixes.
Either changes that are low risk (ie: independent new features) or changes that have been thoroughly tested in new versions.
